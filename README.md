In order for the code to be run, some elements have to be in the directory, that could not be uploaded on the Githubb main branch:

- An empty folder called "outputs"
- A folder called "artifacts" with files called "model.pth", "linreg_model.pkl", "rf_model.pkl" and "catboost_model.pkl". This folder will be provided
- A folder named "Deepdensity". It will also be sent
- The folders are all on a folder named "Folders_needed_for_code". Make sure to remove them from that folder and into the directory when you want to run the code

The code that should be run in main.py
The folder that will be sent will be shared via Outlook to m.holloway@imperial.ac.uk
