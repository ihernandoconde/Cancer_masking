                <h2>What is Breast Cancer?</h2>
                <p>
                    Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in women worldwide.</p>

                <p> It is estimated that 1 in 8 women will develop breast cancer during their
                    lifetime. With early detection, survival rates exceeds 90% so, if possible,
                    a regular screening is recommended. </p>
                <p> Due to healthcare access disparity,
                    diagnostics remain a challenge in low-resource regions. </p>
                <p> With our software
                    you can upload you screening results and it will provide you with knowledge
                    to understand your risk better.</p>

                <h1>Risk Factors</h1>
                <h2> What are the main risk factors?</h2>
                <p>
                    Apart from enviromental and genetic factors, breast density is a main risk factor for breast cancer development.
                    Knowing which breast density category one falls under is important
                    also due to the inconvenient fact that dense breast tends to mask
                    cancer.</p>
                <p> On a mammogram, dense tissue is white and less dense tissue
                    (fatty tissue) is grey. Abnormalities such as cancer show up as white
                    on mammogram. In dense tissues, it is therefore hard to identify what
                    might be cancer and what might just be the tissue, therefore delaying
                    early detection and diagnosis. </p>
                <p> Higher breast density makes women 4- 6
                    times more likely to develop breast cancer.</p>

                <p> Another risk factor is asymmetry in breast density between both breasts,
                    which occurs when results from both breasts have a noticeable difference.
                    This can be an early sign of developing malignancy.</p>

                <h1>What are BI-RADS?</h1>
                <h2> How do you measure breast density?</h2>
                <p>
                    The term BI-RADS stands for Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System.
                    It is scale that helps radiologists and doctors classify findings from
                    breast imaging and identify risk levels for developing breast cancers.</p>

                <p> It ranges from 1 to 4: a BI-RADS score of 1 signifies that there is no
                    cancer while a score of 4 suggests abnormal results that might require
                    a further testing. </p>
                <p> This system also includes breast density categories
                    (A to D), depending on the density of the breast. In this scale a BI-RADS
                    score of A indicates lower density, while a score of D is the highest.</p>

                <div class="main__text" id="explanatory_grid">
                    <p>We trained our software on public datasets to identify the BI-RADS category of
                        breast density (A, B, C or D), so that by uploading you mammogram you can
                        check your possible risk. </p>
                    <p> If desired, you can also upload two mammograms, one of
                        each breast, to check the results on both and identify possible asymmetries.</p>
                    <p> For a more localized analysis, the density of the four main quadrants will also be outputted.</p>
