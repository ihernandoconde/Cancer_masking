                <h1>Breast Cancer</h1>
                <p>
                    Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in women worldwide.
                    It is estimated that 1 in 8 women will develop breast cancer during their
                    lifetime. With early detection, survival rates exceeds 90% so regular
                    screening is essential if possible. Because of healthcare access disparity,
                    diagnostics remain a challenge in low-resource regions so using our software
                    you can upload you screening results to understand your risk better.

                <h1>Risk Factors</h1>
                <p>
                    Breast density is a main risk factor for breast cancer development.
                    Dense breast tissue consists of more fibrous tissue instead of fatty tissue
                    and it makes it harder to identify abnormalities when screening. Higher
                    breast density makes women 4 to 6 times more likely to develop breast cancer,
                    and it hides tumours on imaging, delaying diagnosis.

                    Another risk factor is asymmetry in breast density between both breasts, which
                    occurs when results from both breast have a noticeable difference, this can
                    be an early sign of developing malignancy.

                <h1>What are BI-RADS?</h1>
                <p>
                    The BI-RADS scale helps radiologists and doctors classify findings from breast
                    imaging and identify risk levels for developing breast cancers. It ranges from 1 to 4,
                    BI-RADS 1 meaning normal findings while BI-RADS 4 suggests abnormal results that might
                    require a further testing. This systems includes breast density categories (A to D)
                    which depend on density results, a risk factor of breast cancer. In this scale, A being
                    lower density and D being highest, as seen below.

                    <p>We trained our software on public datasets to identify the BI-RAD category of
                        breast density (either A, B, C or D), so that by uploading you mammogram you can
                        check your possible risk. If desired, you can also upload two mammograms, one of
                        each breast to check the results on both and identify possible asymmetry.
                        For a more localized analysis, the density of the four main quadrants will also be outputted.

                        Warning: our software has  been trained on public datasets and has a 90% accuracy
                        rate, but it is not FDA approved and should not be taken as a professional opinion,
                        always consult with your doctor. We do not save any images or resulting information.
